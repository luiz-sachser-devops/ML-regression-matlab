Abstract—In this document we explore three datasets found on Kaggle: “Fish Market”, “Monthly Milk Production” and “BitCoin Price”, for each of these datasets we created 20
Artificial Neural Networks, 10 for each of 2 algorithms (Scaled Conjugate Gradient and the Resilient Backpropagation), and trained them, obtaining the values for the Performance and the
Correlation Coefficient (also known as the R coefficient).
